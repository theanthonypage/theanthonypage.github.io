<p class="regular indent">I named Cassano Ristorante after the town in which my family originated: "Cassano delle Murge." This quaint  town is located about 200 miles south of Rome, in Apulia (Bari). Despite being born and raised in New York, Italian was my first language and I have traveled to Cassano over a dozen times to visit my relatives. I've even had the pleasure of taking my lovely wife, Christina, and our two beautiful children, Giovanni and Gianna, there to witness the wonderful place where I proudly hold my roots.</p>

<p class="regular indent">My grandfather owns and maintains some of the many grape vineyards and olive farms that shape this town, which I will one day inherit in order to carry on the family tradition of making fresh olive oil and homemade wine. Also abundant in Cassano are tomatoes, artichokes, cherries and almonds. Since it is on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, the region of Bari takes great pride in its seafood industry as well.</p>

<p class="regular indent">Many of the ingredients we use are indigenous to the Apulia region, and many of our dishes are derived from secret family recipes. While Cassano delle Murge is not a popular tourist town, those who have had the pleasure of visiting know that the food is definitely something to write home about! I certainly hope to give you that same experience when you dine right here with us in Hauppauge, NY.</p>
